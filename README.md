# Minesweeper Classic #

This is a browser-based clone of the version of Minesweeper bundled with
Windows editions prior to Vista. This project is purely for fun, and the goal
is to emulate the original Minesweeper game as closely as possible.

To play, simply open `index.html` in your favorite Internet browser.

A demo of the game in its development state is available (for better or worse)
[here](http://nickolai.brandonjd.net:8080/ms/). This link will change when the
project is polished.
