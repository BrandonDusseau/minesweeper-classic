# Minesweeper Classic #

This is a browser-based clone of the Windows 2000 version of Minesweeper, written in JavaScript.
This implementation includes most of the features found in the real thing, including a functional classic Windows-style windowing environment (dubbed SweeperOS).

Minesweeper Classic can be set up by downloading the latest release ZIP and placing its contents on a directory of a web
server. The game can also be played locally.

A live demo of the latest release of the game is available [on my website](http://www.brandonjd.net/minesweeper/).
